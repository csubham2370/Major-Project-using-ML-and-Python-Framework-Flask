Sure, let's break down each line of this HTML code:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is a document type declaration, also known as a doctype declaration. It informs the web browser that the document is written in HTML5.

2. `<html lang="en">`: This is the opening `<html>` tag, indicating the start of the HTML document. The `lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the document, which is English in this case.

3. `<head>`: This is the opening `<head>` tag. It contains meta-information about the document, such as the character encoding, viewport settings, title, and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts.

4. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, which is UTF-8. UTF-8 is a widely-used character encoding that supports a wide range of characters from various languages.

5. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties for responsive web design. It ensures that the width of the viewport is set to the width of the device, and the initial zoom level is set to 1.0, meaning the page will be displayed at its full width without any zooming by default.

6. `<title>Document</title>`: This is the `<title>` tag, which sets the title of the HTML document. The text inside the `<title>` tag, in this case, is "Document". This title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

7. `</head>`: This is the closing `</head>` tag, which marks the end of the `<head>` section.

8. `<body>`: This is the opening `<body>` tag, which marks the beginning of the document's body content. The main content of the web page, such as text, images, and other elements, goes inside the `<body>` tag.

9. `</body>`: This is the closing `</body>` tag, which marks the end of the document's body content.

10. `</html>`: This is the closing `</html>` tag, which marks the end of the HTML document. All HTML content must be contained within the `<html>` and `</html>` tags.
